This file contains		some 	sentences to write or read. Each line of this text document will be read with some parser and then written to another text file.
	So some randome words would be stored there.
For example some set of letters will be considered as words: asdfasfd, asdfasfd, asdaf, asdfaf.
And maybe some questions?
Or some emotional           sentences! Even sets of words or letter with brackets or parentheses: {another}, [word], (qazxsw), "qwer", 'asdfasf'.
